## 👋🏽 Hey there, my name is Emmanuella Odiete

Welcome to my GitHub space — where data meets story, and insights come alive.  

---

I'm a Data Analyst with a passion for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in **Power BI**, **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python**, and I love creating dashboards that tell meaningful stories.

I’m passionate about **storytelling through data**.  
To me, every dataset has a heartbeat — a trail of decisions, behaviors, and hidden questions.  
My job is to listen, analyze, and reveal those stories with clarity and empathy.

Whether it’s helping a business retain its customers or visualizing performance trends, I bring my curiosity, design eye, and love for structure to every project.
