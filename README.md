## 👋🏽 Hey there, my name is Emmanuella Odiete

Welcome to my GitHub space — where data meets story and insights come alive.

---

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a passion for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in **Power BI**, **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python**, and I love creating dashboards that don’t just display numbers, but tell meaningful stories.

I believe that every dataset has a heartbeat — a trail of decisions, behaviors, and hidden questions, and my job is to listen, analyze, and reveal those stories with clarity, empathy, and impact.

Whether I’m helping a business understand its customers or visualizing performance trends, I bring curiosity, a design eye, and a love for structure into every project.
